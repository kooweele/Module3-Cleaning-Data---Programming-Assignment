This is the code book that describes the process performned the clean up data
Pre-condition: 
1. All Files must be downloaded and unzipped from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
   into local drive
   
2. Before running, update the 3 paths specified in the following methods:
  - setWorkingPath_UCIHARDatasetPath: set the local path that contain the extracted files  
  - setWorkingPath_TrainingData: set the path that contain the training data
  - setWorkingPath_TestData: set the path that contain the testing data

Execution of the main routine "run_analysis" in R do these:- 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   - Reads the Test data of subjects, activity with activity names perform, all 561 meaurements related to each observation into a dataframe and return
   - Reads the Training data of subjects, activity with activity names perform, all 561 meaurements related to each observation into a dataframe and return
   - Merge the 2 datasets together (without activity_id)
   
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   - Clean up the 561 measurements by subsetting ONLY features (column names) with keywords "mean" and "std"
   - The intermediate dataframe will contain the subject only subject_id, activity_name and columns readings of "mean" and "std"
   
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   - Clean the column names by turning them to lower cases and removing the brackets which are in the raw data
   
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   - All the column names are preserved with descriptive names as defined in "features.txt" and "features_info.txt" in small CAPS and without brackets
   - New added columns: 
         - subject_id: Identifier of the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.  [DONE]
         - activity_name: The activity label on the observation performed by the subject

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   - With the data frame from Step 4, a new aggregated data frame is create by grouping the results (from Step 4) with <subject_id, activity_name> 
   - A new dataframe is of based on summary means for each column is created.
   - The result is then output as "tidy_data.txt"
   
Post Condition:
1. Result is a file named "tidy_data.txt" in your working R homedir
