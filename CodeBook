This is the code book that describes the process performned the clean up data
Pre-condition: 
1. All Files must be downloaded and unzipped from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
   into local drive
2. Before running, update the 3 paths specified in the following methods:
  - setWorkingPath_UCIHARDatasetPath: set the local path that contain the extracted files  
  - setWorkingPath_TrainingData: set the path that contain the training data
  - setWorkingPath_TestData: set the path that contain the testing data

Execution of the main routine "run_analysis" in R do these:- 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.	
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Post Condition:
1. Result is a file named "tidy_data.txt" in your working R homedir
